# Single Linear Regression -- from scratch & Sklearn
this project implements linear regression based on single variable ( population size )
to predict output ( profit )

## Features
- Data preprocessing and displays the data
- calculate  mathimatically cost function and gradient descent
- setup iterations to stop if the cost function decreases a too little
- drawing graph for profits vs population size
- predicting by sklearn a new profit value based on population size
- displays a graph for profits vs population size and a graph for cost function vs iterations by sklearn


## Dataset Structure

### Dataset Source

- The dataset used in this project is from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course programming exercises.
- **File:** [data_single_var.txt](data/data_single_var.txt)

The model trains on a two-column dataset (`data_single_var.txt`):

- **Population**: The size of the city population (independent variable X).
- **Profit**: The profit of the city (dependent variable y).


## implementation Details
- reading the data , naming the columns and Skipinit so that any spaces in data it removes
- convert data to numeric values so that any npn-numeric values are turned into Nan
- show the data and its description to ensure it's appropriate and has no missing values
- add one's column
- divide the data into inputs and outputs
- seperate features for sklearn ( before converting them into matrix) 
- converting the data into matrix and make theta


### implementation cost function
- implement cost function manually to measure how well prediction line fits training data
- def compute_cost( X , y , theta) : 
- mathimatically equation = 1 / ( 2 * m ) * sum( ( predicted value - actual value )^2 )
- m = number of training data


### implementation gradient descent
-  implement gradient descent manually to guess thetas and decrease cost function
-  Instead of guessing the weights or using exhaustive searching
-  Gradient Descent calculates the partial derivative (the slope) of the cost function.
-  This tells the model exactly which direction to move its parameters and by how much,
-  ensuring that with each epoch, the prediction error decreases until it reaches the global minimum.

- if i > 0 and abs ( cost[i - 1] - cost[i] ) < 0.00003 :
- setup iteration when the cost fun decreases a too little it stops iterations at alpha = 0.01
- drawing predicted profit vs population size by traditional way
- x = the start and end point for regression line
- f = equation of linear regression ( expected values )


### predicting by SKlearn
- lin_reg is a object from LinearRegression class
- `fit()` method ( and out manual gradient ) represents the actual training phase of ML model
- it takes input features and target labels to iteratuvely adjust the parameters ( theta1 , theta2 )
- it optimizes thetas until cost function reaches into the global minimam
- establish the best regression line fits the data

`predict()` method takes inputs ( test data ) and produces the predicted values based on regression line


### drawing by sklearn
 - draw a graph for predicted profit vs population size
 - draw a graph for Cost function vs iterations


## Results
- Cost before gradient = 32.072733877455676 
- Cost after gradient = 4.4846848047288494 
- Cost = [6.73719046 5.93159357 5.90115471 ... 4.48476876 4.48474067 4.48471269]
- Number of iterations = 1448
- theta after gradient = [[-3.60470313  1.16379173]]
- predicted profit for 70k people = 44554.55
- predicted profit for 10k people = -27027.47
- predicted profit for 40k people = 8763.54

- os


## 🎓 Educational Purpose
This repository was created strictly for **educational and learning purposes**.
The primary goal of this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical Machine Learning mathematics and practical code.
By coding the Cost Function and Gradient Descent from scratch using NumPy matrices,
I aimed to deeply understand how optimization algorithms work behind the scenes
before transitioning to high-level production libraries like Scikit-Learn.
